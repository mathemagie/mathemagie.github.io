# Shader Enhancement Ideas

Ray marching for true 3D blob depth - render blobs as volumetric spheres with proper occlusion
Glass container refraction/reflection - simulate the curved glass enclosure with light bending
Heat distortion shimmer effect - add wavy distortion around hot blob edges
Bloom post-processing pass - soft glow bleeding from bright areas using multi-pass rendering
Particle-based bubble formation - small rising bubbles inside the liquid using point sprites
Temperature-reactive color mapping - blobs shift from cool blue to hot orange based on position
Enhanced subsurface scattering - light penetrating and scattering inside translucent blobs
Volumetric lighting / god rays - light shafts emanating from the top light source
CRT scanlines for retro aesthetic - horizontal scan lines with subtle flicker
Motion blur on fast-moving blobs - directional blur based on blob velocity
Voronoi cell patterns for texture - organic cellular patterns on blob surfaces
Environment cube map reflections - reflect a virtual environment on blob surfaces
Iridescent / oil-slick color shifting - rainbow sheen that changes with viewing angle
Plasma wave mixing effect - classic demoscene plasma waves blended with the liquid
Holographic shimmer overlay - subtle rainbow interference patterns
Warp distortion fields around blobs - gravitational lensing effect near blob centers
Ambient occlusion for depth - darker areas where blobs meet or approach edges
Animated internal textures - flowing patterns inside the blobs like real wax
Outline / cel-shading mode toggle - cartoon-style edges for a different aesthetic
Audio-reactive shader parameters - blob size/color/speed responds to sound input
