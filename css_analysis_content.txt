The `lines/css/styles.css` file is responsible for the entire visual presentation of the "Lines" interactive art project, ensuring a clean interface, responsive layout, and smooth user experience.

1.  **Overall Purpose**:
    *   **Page Styling**: It sets a basic style for the `body`, ensuring it fills the viewport (`min-height: 100vh`), centers its content (the canvas), and has a default background color (`#f0f0f0`, though the canvas itself is black). It also hides overflow to prevent scrollbars and disables default touch actions (`touch-action: none`) for a smoother touch experience on the canvas.
    *   **Canvas Styling**: The `canvas` element is set to `display: block` to remove any extra space below it that might occur if it were treated as an inline element.
    *   **UI Elements**: It styles all interactive UI components, including the main control panel, the panel toggle button, sliders, buttons, and labels, ensuring they are visually distinct and user-friendly.

2.  **Control Panel Styling (`#controls`)**:
    *   **Appearance**: The panel (`#controls`) has a semi-transparent dark background (`rgb(0 0 0 / 85%)`), white text color (`#fff`), padding (`20px`), rounded corners (`border-radius: 12px`), and a subtle box shadow (`box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%)`) for a modern, layered look.
    *   **Positioning**: By default, it's absolutely positioned at the top-right of the screen (`top: 20px; right: 20px;`). Its `z-index: 100` ensures it floats above the canvas.
    *   **Width**: It has a responsive width `width: min(280px, 85vw)`, meaning it will be at most 280px wide, but will shrink to 85% of the viewport width on smaller screens.
    *   **Hide/Show Transition**:
        *   Initially, it's hidden by a `transform: translateX(calc(100% + 20px))` (pushing it off-screen to the right) and `opacity: 0%`. The `pointer-events: none` ensures it doesn't intercept interactions when hidden.
        *   The `.hidden` class enforces this hidden state.
        *   A `transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;` is applied, allowing the panel to smoothly slide in and out and fade when its visibility is toggled (by removing/adding the `.hidden` class via JavaScript).
        *   The `.js-loaded` class (added by JavaScript) sets `display: block`, making it visible once JavaScript has confirmed it can manage its state.

3.  **Control Elements Styling**:
    *   **Panel Toggle Button (`#panel-toggle`)**:
        *   Styled as a circular button (`border-radius: 50%`) with a dark background, white icon, and positioned at the top-right.
        *   It has a larger touch target (`width: 48px; height: 48px;`) and font size (`24px`).
        *   A `transition: background-color 0.2s` provides feedback on hover.
    *   **Control Groups (`.control-group`)**: Provides spacing (`margin-bottom: 20px;`) between different sets of controls.
    *   **Labels (`.control-label`)**: Uses flexbox to arrange the label text and its value display (`<span>`) on opposite sides. Font size is increased for readability.
    *   **Sliders (`input[type='range']`)**:
        *   Custom styled for a consistent look across browsers. Default appearance is removed (`appearance: none;`).
        *   The track (`::-webkit-slider-runnable-track`) is a light, rounded bar.
        *   The thumb (`::-webkit-slider-thumb`) is a white circle.
        *   Increased height (`height: 24px;`) for better touch interaction.
    *   **Theme Buttons (`.theme-button`)**:
        *   Arranged in a 2x2 grid (`display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);`) for easy access.
        *   Have a dark background, white text, padding, rounded corners, and a hover effect.
        *   The `.active` class highlights the selected theme.
        *   Specific themes (`#theme-neon`, `#theme-pastel`, `#theme-mono`) have unique top/bottom borders for visual distinction (though the HTML for these buttons is commented out in the provided `index.html`).
    *   **Sound Toggle Button (`#sound-toggle`)**:
        *   A larger icon font size (`28px`) with padding, a subtle border, and rounded corners.
        *   Text color changes on hover, and a transition is applied to these properties.

4.  **Responsive Design (Media Queries)**:
    *   **Small Screens (max-width: 480px - typically portrait mobile)**:
        *   `#controls`: Repositioned to the bottom center of the screen (`top: auto; bottom: 20px; right: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);`) and width adjusted to `85vw`. The hide/show transition is updated accordingly (`transform: translateY(calc(100% + 20px)) translateX(50%);`).
        *   `#panel-toggle`: Moved to the bottom-right.
        *   Slider thumb and track sizes are increased for easier touch interaction.
    *   **Mobile Landscape (max-height: 500px and orientation: landscape)**:
        *   `#controls`: Repositioned to the top-right, width fixed at `250px`, `max-height` set to `80vh` with `overflow-y: auto` to allow scrolling if content exceeds available height. The hide/show transition is adjusted to slide horizontally.
        *   Control group margins are reduced for a more compact layout.
        *   A custom scrollbar style is applied to the control panel.
    *   **Larger Tablets (min-width: 768px and max-width: 1024px)**:
        *   `#controls`: Width increased to `320px`.
        *   Control label font size and slider height are slightly increased.

5.  **Animations and Transitions**:
    *   **Control Panel Visibility**: As mentioned, `transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;` on `#controls` provides a smooth slide and fade effect.
    *   **Button Hovers**: Generic transitions like `transition: background-color 0.2s;` are used on buttons (`#panel-toggle`, `.theme-button`) for visual feedback.
    *   **Sound Toggle Hover**: `transition: all 0.3s ease;` for smooth changes in background and text color.
    *   **Touch Feedback Animation (`.touch-feedback`)**:
        *   Uses a `@keyframes pulsate` animation (scale and opacity changes) for 0.5s to give visual feedback on double-tap for eraser size change.
    *   **Mode Feedback Notification (`.mode-feedback`)**:
        *   Uses a `@keyframes fade-in-out` (opacity and transform changes) for 1.8s to display "Eraser Mode" or "View Mode" notifications. This involves fading in, staying visible, and then fading out while slightly moving.

6.  **Specific UI Features Styling**:
    *   **Theme Buttons**: Although the HTML might be commented out, styles exist. `.theme-button.active` clearly indicates the selected theme. Unique border styles for different themes (`#theme-neon`, `#theme-pastel`, `#theme-mono`) provide visual cues for each theme type.
    *   **Sound Toggle (`#sound-toggle`)**: Styled to clearly indicate its function, changing its text content (icon) via JavaScript, while CSS handles its interactive styling (hover effects).
    *   **Feedback Indicators**:
        *   `.touch-feedback`: A temporary element styled to provide a pulsating visual cue at the point of a double-tap.
        *   `.mode-feedback`: A temporary, centered notification styled with a semi-transparent background and white text to inform the user of mode changes (e.g., "Eraser Mode"). Its `z-index: 1000` ensures it's visible above other elements.

In summary, `styles.css` is crucial for creating an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and responsive user interface for the "Lines" project. It uses modern CSS techniques for layout, transitions, animations, and responsive adjustments to enhance the user experience across various devices.
