# Game Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines suggested enhancements for better maintainability, richer gameplay, and improved user experience.

## 1. Architecture & Maintainability
- Split the single `<script>` block into separate JavaScript modules (e.g., `dino.js`, `obstacles.js`, `background.js`, `audio.js`).
- Encapsulate game objects into ES6 classes (Dino, Obstacle, Hole, BackgroundLayer) to reduce global state and improve extensibility.
- Introduce a simple build step with tools like Rollup or Webpack to manage imports/exports, linting (ESLint), and minification.

## 2. Gameplay & Mechanics
- Implement a running animation cycle by swapping between multiple Dino sprite frames.
- Add new obstacle types (e.g., flying pterodactyls, moving barriers) and power‑ups (shields, speed boosts).
- Introduce difficulty waves or milestone events (e.g., every 1,000 points, spawn a burst of faster obstacles).
- Reward combos or multipliers for clearing several obstacles without using voice or keyboard input.

## 3. UX & Visual Polish
- Add a loading screen or progress indicator during asset preload.
- Use integer‑only canvas scaling and pixelated CSS settings to ensure crisp look on high‑DPI displays.
- Implement a day/night sky cycle by gradually shifting background colors over time.
- Create particle effects on landing or when passing through a hole to enhance visual feedback.

## 4. Audio & Feedback
- Include an optional background music track with on/off toggle.
- Provide a volume calibration UI or slider so players can adjust the microphone sensitivity at runtime.
- Vary jump SFX (e.g., choose from multiple samples) and add landing or collision sounds.

## 5. Persistence & Social Features
- Persist high score and user settings (volume threshold, background music on/off) in `localStorage` so they survive page reloads.
- Offer a “Share Your Score” feature that generates a social‑media friendly link or screenshot.

## 6. Performance & Robustness
- Remove or guard excessive `console.log` calls in production builds to avoid slowing down the game loop.
- Cap maximum game speed or dynamically adjust spawn rates so very fast devices don’t make the game unplayable.
- Debounce or throttle the `windowResized` handler to avoid layout thrashing when resizing the browser.

## 7. Accessibility & Cross‑Platform
- Add an on‑screen jump button or large touch zone for mobile users without keyboards.
- Provide a mute‑mic button for players in public or noisy environments.
- Test and polyfill `getUserMedia` behavior across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari on iOS).

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for core logic (collision detection, obstacle spawning intervals).
- Automate code formatting and linting with pre‑commit hooks to maintain consistency.
- Bundle a basic debug panel or “FPS counter” to aid performance profiling.
