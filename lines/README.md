# Lines - Interactive Art Experience

âœ¨ Immerse yourself in a mesmerizing world of flowing lines that respond to your touch and movement. This interactive art piece creates a dynamic canvas where colorful lines fade in and out, creating an ever-changing visual symphony.

ðŸŽ¨ Customize your experience with intuitive controls - adjust line thickness, length, and watch as your artistic vision comes to life. The minimalist interface keeps the focus on the art while giving you creative freedom.

ðŸ§¹ Use the realistic gum eraser to remove lines and create your own patterns. The satisfying eraser effect lets you "draw" with negative space, adding another dimension to your creative process.

ðŸŽµ Experience spatial soundscapes that move through your environment as lines interact. The gentle tones flow from side to side, creating a three-dimensional audio experience that complements the visual elements with subtle movement.
